# Assign 0 - Use Github

This assignment is to demostrate how Github Classroom works and how we will be using it in class.

## Steps
1. Accept the assignment via the assinment link
2. Clone the repo to your desktop.
3. Use the aboutMe.md file to make changes. The final file should be about yourself.
4. Create this branch structure and commits:

![](https://github.com/DGM3780/Assign-0---Use-Github/blob/master/assets/Commits.png)

(This is 7 commits total, including the merge commit. 4 commits on `master` and 2 on `new-feature` and one merge commit)

5. Push to your repo
6. Turn in a link to your repo in Canvas
  
  
## Tips
- This is how all of our assingments will be done and turned in. Be sure to commit often while working on assinments.
- When using Github, be sure to clone the repo from Github using the `git clone` command.
- If you don't already have SSH Keys set up for github, I would HIGHLY recomend setting those up. [Click here for Github Help](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent)
- Don't be worried about writing "dirty" code. The idea here is to have a working prototype. I am not expecting production ready code.
